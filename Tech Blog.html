<p>This picture shows how robots telling a human that they are fired because these robots will soon take over our jobs.One study from Gartner Research states that while 1.8 million jobs will be lost by 2020, 2.3 million new ones will be created. the transition to a workless future is the biggest challenge by far, and it will have a major impact in society. We need to start finding a solution to this problem if we dont, we will have a jobless future.

I belive that in one or two decades, at least half of us will lose our job to robots. they can  take artistic jobs too. If youre a artist,Robots will paint and write and sculpt better than you. If you dig ditches, a robot will dig them better. If you’re a magazine writer, a robot will write your articles better. If you’re a doctor, robots can get test back to the patients faster than you can.

	<p> Reading this makes me worried and anxious because of the fact that in the future most of us will lose our jobs becaue of how advaced these robots are. The fact that 1.8 billion jobs will be lost should make us prepare for what will soon come.  </p>
